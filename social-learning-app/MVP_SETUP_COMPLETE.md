# Social Learning App MVP - Setup Complete ðŸš€

## What's Been Built

### Backend (NestJS + TypeScript)
âœ… **Complete API Infrastructure**
- JWT Authentication system with registration/login
- PostgreSQL database with TypeORM entities (User, Book, Insight, Interaction)
- Redis caching layer for performance optimization
- RESTful API endpoints for all core features:
  - `/auth/*` - Authentication & user management
  - `/books/*` - Book management and search
  - `/insights/*` - Content creation and feed
  - `/interactions/*` - Social features (like, save, share, apply)

âœ… **Key Features Implemented**
- User registration/login with JWT tokens
- Insight creation and feed algorithm
- Social interactions (like, share, save, apply)
- Book management system
- Real-time engagement metrics
- Rate limiting and security
- Comprehensive error handling

### Frontend (React Native + Expo)
âœ… **Core Mobile App Structure**
- Authentication screens (Login/Register)
- Feed screen with infinite scroll
- State management with Zustand
- API integration with Axios interceptors
- Secure token storage with Expo SecureStore
- TypeScript types for all entities

## Next Steps for You (The Designer/Product Owner)

### 1. **Set Up Development Environment** (15 mins)
```bash
cd /Users/spencermerrill/social-learning-app/social-learning-app

# Terminal 1 - Start Backend
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials
npm run start:dev

# Terminal 2 - Start Mobile App
cd mobile
npm start
```

### 2. **Database Setup Required**
You'll need to set up PostgreSQL and Redis:
- **PostgreSQL**: Install locally or use a service like Supabase/Railway
- **Redis**: Install locally or use a service like Upstash
- Update the `.env` file in `/backend/` with your connection strings

### 3. **Immediate UI/UX Decisions Needed**
- [ ] **Color Palette**: Currently using basic blue (#3b82f6) - needs your design touch
- [ ] **Typography**: Default system fonts - consider custom typography
- [ ] **Iconography**: Using emoji placeholders - need proper icon system
- [ ] **Component Library**: Basic styles - should we use NativeBase, Tamagui, or custom?

### 4. **Key Screens Still Needed** (Design Priority)
1. **Onboarding Flow** - First-time user experience
2. **Book Search/Selection** - How users find and select books
3. **Insight Creation** - Interface for sharing insights
4. **Profile Screen** - User profile and settings
5. **Book Details** - Individual book pages with insights
6. **Notifications** - Push notification handling

### 5. **Critical Features to Complete** (Next 2 weeks)
- [ ] Offline-first architecture with SQLite
- [ ] Push notifications setup
- [ ] Image upload for book covers/user avatars
- [ ] Content moderation pipeline
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Analytics integration

## Technical Architecture Highlights

### Backend API Routes
```
POST   /auth/register          - User registration
POST   /auth/login             - User login
GET    /auth/profile           - Get user profile

GET    /insights/feed          - Get personalized feed
POST   /insights               - Create new insight
GET    /insights/:id           - Get single insight
DELETE /insights/:id           - Delete insight

POST   /interactions           - Create interaction (like/save/etc)
GET    /interactions/user      - Get user's interactions

GET    /books/search           - Search books
GET    /books/popular          - Get popular books
POST   /books                  - Add new book
```

### Mobile App Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ types/           - TypeScript interfaces
â”œâ”€â”€ config/          - API configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ stores/          - Zustand state management
â”œâ”€â”€ screens/         - React Native screens
â”œâ”€â”€ components/      - Reusable components (to be created)
â”œâ”€â”€ navigation/      - Navigation setup (to be created)
â””â”€â”€ utils/           - Helper functions (to be created)
```

## Development Workflow Recommendations

1. **Design First**: Create mockups for each screen using Figma
2. **Component Library**: Build reusable components before screens
3. **API Testing**: Use tools like Postman to test backend endpoints
4. **Incremental Development**: Build one feature completely before moving to next
5. **Testing Strategy**: Set up basic testing for critical user flows

## Immediate Action Items for You

### Day 1-2: Environment Setup
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Set up Redis instance  
- [ ] Run backend and mobile app locally
- [ ] Test authentication flow

### Day 3-5: Design System
- [ ] Create design system in Figma
- [ ] Define color palette, typography, spacing
- [ ] Design key screens (Feed, Login, Profile)
- [ ] Choose/set up component library

### Week 2: Core Features
- [ ] Implement book search/selection UI
- [ ] Build insight creation interface
- [ ] Add offline capabilities
- [ ] Set up push notifications

## Database Schema (Already Created)
- **Users**: Authentication, profiles, settings

**Your role**: Focus on design, user experience, and product decisions. The technical foundation is solid and ready for your creative vision!

**Questions for you**:
1. What should the primary brand colors be?
2. What's the target user demographic for initial launch?
3. Should we focus on iOS first, or both platforms simultaneously?
4. What book categories should we prioritize for the MVP?
