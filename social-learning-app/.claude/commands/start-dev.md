Start the Social Learning App development environment by:

1. Starting the NestJS backend server on port 3000
2. Starting the React Native app with Expo on iPhone 16 simulator
3. Both services should run concurrently and be accessible for testing

Use the development script that handles both services and provides proper cleanup when stopped.

Run the npm dev script to start everything at once.
